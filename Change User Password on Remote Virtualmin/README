Remote Virtualmin Password Driver

Driver that adds functionality to change the users Virtualmin password, in remote server, using Virtualmin API.

IMPORTANT :: Limitations and Security
- By design the Virtualmin API needs the root user to perform these actions.
- This is a limitation in my opinion, of the Virtualmin API itself.
- To increase the security, i've create a database table, where the Admin can store
  the root password of each permited server. The password is stored in AES Encryption,
  and you must define the AES Decryption Key, so you can read it, to connect to your
  Virtualmin remote server.
- The AES Decryption Key, Connection User (by default: root), Virtualmin Port (by default: 10000)
  must be declared in the variables $config['remote_virtualmin_aeskey'], $config['vminruser']
  and $config['vminrport'], located in plugins/password/config,inc.php

INSTALATION:
- Change the config.inc.php, as described, and transfer to your roundcube instalation;
- Change the virtualmin_remote.php driver, as described, and transfer to your roundcube instalation;

USAGE:
- Login to Roundcube Webmail, access to settings->password;
- Change your user/email password;
- To debug the connection to the remote virtualmin server, uncomment the debug line in virtualmin_remote.php;
